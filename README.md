- `src/pages/*.md`: project information, governance, community, quickstart, and privacy.
- `src/pages/*.astro`: homepage, specification index, implementation directory, and protocol overview.
- `src/data/site.ts`: navigation, specification links, and SDK listings.
- `src/layouts/`: shared page layouts.
- `src/styles/global.css`: site styles.

## Deployment

Enable GitHub Pages with **GitHub Actions** as the source. Pushes to `main` run
validation and deploy through the `github-pages` environment. The deployment
workflow can also be run manually.

The workflow reads the site's URL from GitHub Pages. For a local build,
`SITE_URL` sets the canonical origin and base path; the default is `https://ansinfo.ai/`.

```sh
SITE_URL=https://example.github.io/ansinfo-site/ npm run build
SITE_URL=https://example.github.io/ansinfo-site/ npm test
```
